  <p> I am an independent jewelry maker in Russellville, Arkansas. I specialize in making wrapped crystals that are unique to each piece! All the jewelry purchased on my website is hand made and at the highest quality. If you have any questions about placing an order or about a previous order, go to the "Contact" page.</p>
  <p>I hand pick my crystals and wire and make each item special per order. That means your item is not sitting in storage for months like a chain store would. All items are inspected for quality and are made using professional techniques. As of now, there is no return policy on my products due to Covid-19 as I am unable to resell any returned items whatsoever.</p>
